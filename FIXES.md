# LyX Hotkey Plugin - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed "[object Object]" logging error in inserter.js**
- **Problem**: When `target.tagName` was undefined, logging `{ target: target.tagName }` showed "[object Object]"
- **Fix**: Added proper null checking and fallback values in the logging statement
- **Location**: `src/inserter.js:36`

### 2. **Fixed content script initialization and connection issues**
- **Problem**: Race conditions during module loading and async initialization
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper module loading verification with retry logic
  - Made initialization properly async with completion tracking
  - Added `isInitialized` flag to prevent premature status requests
- **Location**: `content.js`

### 3. **Fixed background script message forwarding**
- **Problem**: "Could not establish connection" errors when forwarding messages
- **Fix**: 
  - Added retry logic to find active content scripts
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added fallback tab detection
- **Location**: `background.js`

### 4. **Fixed key case handling bug**
- **Problem**: Shift+letter combinations were incorrectly lowercased (e.g., "Shift+D" became "Shift+d")
- **Fix**: Preserved correct case when shift modifier is used with letters
- **Location**: `src/hotkeyManager.js:eventToKeyString()`

### 5. **Enhanced debugging and error handling**
- **Problem**: Lack of visibility into binding loading process
- **Fix**: 
  - Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the binding loading flow
  - Enabled debug mode by default for troubleshooting
  - Added better error messages and status reporting

## Key Technical Details

### Parser Functionality ✅
- Successfully parses LyX bind files
- Converts 56 bindings from example.bind
- Properly handles multi-step sequences like "Alt+m g a"

### Key Sequence Detection ✅  
- Correctly detects Alt+M, F sequence
- Triggers \\frac{}{} insertion
- Handles case sensitivity for shifted letters

### Text Insertion ✅
- Works with input, textarea, and contentEditable elements
- Properly handles LaTeX constructs with cursor positioning
- Triggers appropriate DOM events for framework compatibility

## Testing Results

The integration test confirms all core functionality works:
- ✅ 56 bindings loaded successfully
- ✅ Multi-step key sequences detected correctly
- ✅ Text insertion functionality working
- ✅ No errors or warnings during operation

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Plugin should load without errors**
2. **Binding count should show correct number after loading sample bindings**
3. **Hotkey sequences like Alt+M, F should work in editable fields**
4. **No more "[object Object]" errors in console**
5. **No more connection errors between background and content scripts**

The core issues causing "0 hotkeys loaded" and connection failures have been resolved.
